- In order for raw data to become analytics-ready, a number of transformation and cleansing tasks need to be performed on raw data. And that requires you to understand your dataset from multiple perspectives. One of the ways in which you can explore your dataset is to query it. 

- Basic querying techniques can help you explore your data, such as, counting and aggregating a dataset, identifying extreme values, slicing data, sorting data, filtering patterns, and grouping data.

- In a data engineering lifecycle, the performance of data pipelines, platforms, databases, applications, tools, queries, and scheduled jobs, need to be constantly monitored for performance and availability. 

- The performance of a data pipeline can get impacted if the workload increases significantly, or there are application failures, or a scheduled job does not work as expected, or some of the tools in the pipeline run into compatibility issues. 

- Databases are susceptible to outages, capacity overutilization, application slowdown, and conflicting activities and queries being executed simultaneously. 

- Monitoring and alerting systems collect quantitative data in real time to give visibility into the performance of data pipelines, platforms, databases, applications, tools, queries, scheduled jobs, and more.

- Time-based and condition-based maintenance schedules generate data that helps identify systems and procedures responsible for faults and low availability.
