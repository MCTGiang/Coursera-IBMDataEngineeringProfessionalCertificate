# Summary & Highlights

- The relational model is the most used data model for databases because this model allows for logical data independence, physical data independence, and physical storage independence.
- Entities are objects that exist independently of any other entities in the database, while attributes are the data elements that characterize the entity.
- The building blocks of a relationship are entities, relationship sets, and crows foot notations. 
- Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
- When translating an Entity-Relationship Diagram to a relational database table, the entity becomes the table and the attributes become columns in the table.
- Data types define the type of data that can be stored in a column and can include character strings, numeric values, dates/times, Boolean values and more.
- The advantages of using the correct data type for a column are data integrity, data sorting, range selection, data calculations, and the of standard functions.
- In a relational model, a relation is made up of two parts: A relation schema specifying the name of a relation and the attributes and a relation instance, which is a table made up of the attributes, or columns, and the tuples, or rows. 
- Degree refers to the number of attributes, or columns, in a relation. 
- Cardinality refers to the number of tuples, or rows in a relation.
