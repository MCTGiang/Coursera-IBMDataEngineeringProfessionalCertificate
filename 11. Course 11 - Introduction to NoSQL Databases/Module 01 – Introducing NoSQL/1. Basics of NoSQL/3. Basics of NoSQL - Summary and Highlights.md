# Summary and Highlights

- NoSQL means Not only SQL. 
- NoSQL databases have their roots in the open source community. 
- NoSQL database implementations are technically different from each other. 
- Adopting NoSQL databases has several benefits, including storing and retrieving session information and event logging for apps.
- The four main categories of NoSQL databases are Key-Value, Document, Wide Column, and Graph.  
- Key-value NoSQL databases are the least complex architecturally. 
- Document-based NoSQL databases use documents to make values visible for queries. 
- In document-based NoSQL databases, each piece of data is considered a document, which is typically stored in either JSON or XML format. 
- Column-based databases spawned from the architecture of Googleâ€™s Bigtable storage system. 
- The primary use cases for column-based NoSQL databases are event logging and blogs, counters, and data with expiration values. 
- Graph databases store information in entities (nodes) and relationships (edges).
