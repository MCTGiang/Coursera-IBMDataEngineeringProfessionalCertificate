# Summary and Highlights

- ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolated, and Durable. 

- BASE stands for Basic Availability, Soft-state, and Eventual Consistency. 

- ACID and BASE are the consistency models used in relational and NoSQL databases. 

- Distributed databases are physically distributed across data sites by fragmenting and replicating the data. 

- Fragmentation enables an organization to store a large piece of data across all the servers of a distributed system by breaking the data into smaller pieces. 

- You can use the CAP Theorem to classify NoSQL databases. 

- Partition Tolerance is a basic feature of NoSQL databases. 

- NoSQL systems are not a de facto replacement for RDBMS. 

- RDBMS and NoSQL cater to different use cases, which means that your solution could use both RDBMS and NoSQL.
