# Summary & Highlights
- An instance is a logical boundary for a database or set of databases where you organize database objects and set configuration parameters. 
- Common database objects are items that exist within the database such as tables, constraints, indexes, keys, views, aliases, triggers, events, and log files.
- Different RDBMSs use different names for their system objects. Most use the terms system schema, system tables, catalog, or directory.
- Database storage is managed through logical database objects and physical storage.
